# ipp3

Table generators used with [Inspiration Pad Pro3](http://www.nbos.com/products/inspiration-pad-pro)

As a hint to myself for later, do the follow steps to set up symlinks to make ipp3 work gracefully with these files:

1. Install IPP3
2. In the ipp3 directory, locate the Common and Generators sub-directories
3. Copy the 'potato' directory located in the Common folder of this repo to ipp3/Common/potato
4. Copy the 'potato' directory located in the Generators folder of this repo to ipp3/Generators/potato
